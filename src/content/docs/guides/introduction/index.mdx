---

## Introduction 🙏

Sugarcane AI is creating an open marketplace for developers to package and sell high-accuracy, npm-like programmable prompt packages.

The product is designed to address the issues of prompt accuracy and developer productivity by utilizing a microservices approach for prompt and LLM management, saving 80% of development time and server cost for LLM applications.

Focused on the creation of reusable, high-accuracy prompt packages and Micro LLMs, we offer an open-source microservices framework to empower the next 10 million LLM application developers to build prompt packages and train Micro LLMs.

We believe that a community driven package ecosystem is a long term solution for LLM application development similar to other programming languages ecosystems. 🎉

### Open Source Microservices Framework for LLM Agnostic App Development 🚀

Sugarcane AI is supported by an open-source Microservices framework for LLM-agnostic app development, allowing developers to prioritize business logic over LLM selection, cost, and performance. 

With a focus on fine-tuned Language Models (LLMs), prompt management, and Workflows, Sugarcane AI encourages collaborative dataset development and enhances reusability of prompt packages and fine-tuned LLMs, facilitating sharing and monetization on an open marketplace.

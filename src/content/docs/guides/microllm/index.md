## What are Micro LLMs ðŸ§¬ <a name="micro-llms--"></a>

Micro LLMs, or Micro Language Models, are the heart of Sugarcane AI's microservices architecture. These lightweight, fine-tuned language models provide remarkable accuracy, cost-efficiency, and speed for app development scenarios. They outperform traditional base LLMs and empower developers to achieve superior results with less computational overhead.

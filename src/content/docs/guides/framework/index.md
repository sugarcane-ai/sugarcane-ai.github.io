<!-- ## Key Features of Microservices Framework 🚀

- #### Simplify Workflow Development
Develop, train, and manage workflow plugins seamlessly, reducing complexity over the chain of prompts. 💪

- #### Reusable Prompt Packages
Create, share, and reuse high-accuracy prompts with ease, saving time and effort, and facilitating rapid experimentation in production without regression, ensuring performance visibility at every step. 📑

- #### Open Source Community
Collaborate and contribute to the thriving open-source community of developers dedicated to simplifying AI app development using Sugarcane AI. 🌐

## Key Benefits of Microservices Framework 🏗️

#### Focused Development
Microservices allow developers to concentrate on specific AI application components, ensuring clean and modular code. Each service has a clear task, simplifying development and scalability.

#### Boosted Collaboration
Microservices foster collaboration among development teams. Separate teams can work on different services concurrently, accelerating development and innovation for top-notch AI apps.

#### Decoupled Flexibility
In microservices, prompts, data, and the application layer are decoupled, providing flexibility. Developers can fine-tune LLMs, manage prompts, and handle data independently, enabling rapid experimentation and innovation.

#### Robust Reliability, Scalability, and Maintenance
Microservices offer improved reliability, effortless scalability, and streamlined maintenance, ensuring consistent AI app performance without disruptions, regardless of app size, while allowing efficient updates and bug fixes.

Our roadmap for Sugarcane AI is structured around three critical layers within the LLM ecosystem, each designed to empower data scientists and prompt & application developers:

### 1. [*Sugar Factory*](/docs/guides/introduction/) : Prompt Layer üìë

In this phase, we're doubling down on the Prompt Layer. Our mission is to equip you with robust tools for efficient dataset management, prompt control, and Micro LLM training. Expect precise and high-accuracy prompts at your fingertips.

### 2. [*Sugar Bakery*](/docs/guides/introduction/) : Workflow Layer üöÄ

Next, we're turning our focus to the Workflow Layer. Brace yourself for a user-friendly UI toolkit that simplifies workflow design, deployment, and integration. We're making it effortless to build workflows into web, mobile, and chat applications.

### 3. [*Sugar Farm*](/docs/guides/introduction/) : LLM Layer ü§ñ

At the heart of our roadmap lies the LLM Layer, where the magic of Micro LLMs unfolds. We're revamping the way you train and backtest Micro LLMs using labeled datasets, making it more intuitive and efficient. Seamlessly ship your models over APIs, and dive into Sugar Hub, our dedicated platform for sharing and collaborating on fine-tuned Micro LLMs.

### 4. [*Sugar Hub*](/docs/guides/introduction/) : Marketplace Layer üåê

The Marketplace Layer is where the magic happens. We're enhancing this core component to allow you to package, share, and reuse workflows, prompts, and datasets effortlessly across the developer ecosystem, fostering collaboration and innovation across the community.

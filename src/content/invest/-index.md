##### Sugarcane AI is creating an open marketplace for developers to package and sell high-accuracy, npm-like programmable Prompt Packages.

##### The product focuses on solving the problem of prompt accuracy and developer productivity by using a microservices approach for prompt and LLM management, saving 80% of development time and server cost for LLM applications. Centered around the creation of reusable, high-accuracy prompt packages, we are offering an open-source microservices framework to enable the future 10 million developers to contribute to the package ecosystem.

##### The founding team offers a collective 21 years of experience with tech startups and believes that a community-driven package ecosystem is a long-term solution for LLM application development, similar to ecosystems in other programming languages.
